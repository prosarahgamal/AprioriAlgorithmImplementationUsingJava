# Apriori Algorithm Implementation Using Java
Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over transactional databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database.

## usage
add the file with the transactions as transactions.txt

each transaction in a separate line
